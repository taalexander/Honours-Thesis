	Abstract = {The authors discuss the coherence properties of neutron scattering from perfect crystals and apply them to the splitting and coherent recombination of a neutron beam in a Laue-type interferometer. They also point out the difference between neutron and x-ray scattering in such devices and discuss the effect of a relative displacement of the various interferometer slabs on the fringe pattern. All this can be done without using the detailed dynamical theory of x-ray scattering. Various experiments are discussed, especially the neutron-gravity experiment of Colella, Overhauser, and Werner, which is analyzed both in the laboratory frame and in a frame freely falling with the neutron beam. The older electron diffraction experiment of Marton et al., and its relevance to the Aharonov—Bohm effect, is also discussed and reinterpreted, because the standard interpretation is not consistent with the results of the neutron experiment. An Appendix presents a general discussion of the transformation to a uniformly accelerated reference frame, as a guide to help analyze future such experiments.},

@article{green_2,
	Abstract = {The neutron interferometer is a unique instrument that allows one to construct a neutron wave packet of macroscopic size, divide it into two components separated by centimeters, and then coherently recombine them. A number of experiments clearly showing the difference between quantum and classical theory have been performed with it, which are suitable for presentation in elementary quantum courses. This article presents a simple mathematical model of the interferometer, which can be used to illustrate clearly many of the surprising features of quantum systems. For example, one can describe an experiment to determine which component beam the neutron takes (an analog of the two-slit electron experiment). One can then trace in detail the loss of coherence of the wave function, rather than merely invoke the usual "handwaving" uncertainty arguments. The author discusses the effect of gravity on the neutron beam [the classic COW (Colella, Overhauser, and Werner) experiment], including a simple analysis in an accelerated reference frame, and its relation to the equivalence principle, the red shift, and the twin paradox. Also described are the effect of rotation of the neutron by 360° to change its phase, the effect on the wave function of measuring the absence of the particle from a beam ("Dicke's paradox"), and a realizable version of Wheeler's "delayed-choice" experiments, as well as their relation to the problem of "Schrödinger's cat." The treatment is suitable for bright undergraduates and first-year graduate students.},

  abstract={In this work we combine two distinct machine learning methodologies, sequential Monte Carlo and Bayesian experimental design, and apply them to the problem of inferring the dynamical parameters of a quantum system. We design the algorithm with practicality in mind by including parameters that control trade-offs between the requirements on computational and experimental resources. The algorithm can be implemented online (during experimental data collection), avoiding the need for storage and post-processing. Most importantly, our algorithm is capable of learning Hamiltonian parameters even when the parameters change from experiment-to-experiment, and also when additional noise processes are present and unknown. The algorithm also numerically estimates the Cramer–Rao lower bound, certifying its own performance.}

  abstract={In this thesis, several novel techniques are proposed and demonstrated for measuring the coherent properties of materials and testing aspects of quantum information processing using a single crystal neutron interferometer. In particular we introduce methods for reciprocal space encoding of spatial information systematically in a neutron interferometer. First, a proof of principle experiment is conducted for coherent reciprocal space neutron imaging. This newly proposed technique overcomes the limitation of spacial resolution of current two dimensional neutron detectors. Second, an experiment to measure the vertical coherent length of a neutron interferometer is reported, which extends the previously achieved path separation. Third, we propose a new interferometry geometry that reduces the sensitivity of the neutron interferometer to environmental vibrational disturbances. The method is based on a quantum error compensating algorithm. Finally, a new method that is capable of measuring the autocorrelation function of a sample is proposed. This new technique can extend the capability of traditional neutron scattering experiments. All experiments are conducted at the neutron interferometry facility at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).}

We demonstrate and investigate the digital approach to quantum simulation in a system of trapped ions. With sequences of up to 100 gates and 6 qubits, the full time dynamics of a range of spin systems are digitally simulated. Interactions beyond those naturally present in our simulator are accurately reproduced, and quantitative bounds are provided for the overall simulation quality. Our results demonstrate the key principles of digital quantum simulation and provide evidence that the level of control required for a full-scale device is within reach.},
